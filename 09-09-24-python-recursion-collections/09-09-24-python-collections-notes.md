### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **List of Dictionaries (bank database with a list of users):**
   ```python
   users_data = [
       {"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
       {"name": "Bob", "age": 25},
       {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35},
       {"name": "Nizar", "age": 28},
   ]
   ```
   - This initializes a list called `users_data` that contains dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a user with their `name` and `age`.

2. **Accessing the First User (`user_1`) in the List:**
   ```python
   user_1 = users_data[0]
   ```
   - This assigns the first dictionary in the `users_data` list to the variable `user_1`. In this case, `user_1` will be `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`.

3. **Printing the Entire Dictionary of `user_1`:**
   ```python
   print('user 1', user_1)
   ```
   - This prints the entire dictionary for `user_1`, showing `{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}`.

4. **Accessing the `name` Key Using `get`:**
   ```python
   print('user 1 name', user_1.get("name"))
   ```
   - This prints the value associated with the `name` key in `user_1`, which is `"Alice"`.
   - The `.get()` method is used to retrieve the value, which returns `None` if the key doesnâ€™t exist.

5. **Accessing the `age` Key Using Bracket Notation:**
   ```python
   print('user 1 name', user_1["age"])
   ```
   - This prints the value associated with the `age` key in `user_1`, which is `30`.
   - If the key doesn't exist, this will raise a `KeyError`.

6. **Iterating Over Each User in `users_data` and Printing the `name`:**
   ```python
   for data in users_data:
       print(data['name'])
   ```
   - This loop iterates over each dictionary in the `users_data` list.
   - For each dictionary (each user), it prints the value associated with the `name` key.

7. **Adding a New Key-Value Pair `location` to Each User:**
   ```python
   for data in users_data:
       data['location'] = 'Berlin' 
   ```
   - This loop iterates over each dictionary in `users_data`.
   - For each dictionary, it adds a new key `location` with the value `'Berlin'`.

8. **Printing the Entire `users_data` List After Modification:**
   ```python
   print(users_data)
   ```
   - This prints the entire list of dictionaries, now including the new `location` key for each user.

9. **Accessing the `name` of the Third User:**
   ```python
   print(users_data[2]['name'])
   ```
   - This accesses and prints the `name` of the third user in the list, which is `"Charlie"`.

10. **Filtering Users by Age:**
    ```python
    less_than_30 = [user for user in users_data if user['age'] < 30]
    ```
    - This line creates a new list `less_than_30` using list comprehension.
    - Let's break this down:
        - `user for user in users_data`: This part iterates over each dictionary (`user`) in `users_data`.
        - `if user['age'] < 30`: This condition checks if the `age` of the current `user` is less than `30`.
        - If the condition is true, the `user` dictionary is added to the `less_than_30` list.
    - The result is a list of dictionaries containing users who are younger than 30 years old.

### Example Output for `less_than_30`

Given the `users_data`, `less_than_30` will contain:
```python
[
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "location": "Berlin"},
    {"name": "Nizar", "age": 28, "location": "Berlin"}
]
```

These are the users whose ages are less than 30.
