### **Function Explanation:**
```python
def login(counter=3):
    username = input("username : ")
    password = input("password : ")
    if username != "admin" or password != "password":
        print("wrong user data")
        counter -= 1
        print(f"you still have {counter} tries left ")
        if counter == 0:
            print(
                "you have attempted all your tries, are you trying to hack this account ?"
            )
            return
        login(counter)
    else:
        print("welcome admin")
```

### **How the Function Works:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - The function `login()` starts with a default `counter` value of `3`, which represents the number of allowed login attempts.

2. **Taking Input:**
   - The function prompts the user to enter a `username` and `password`.

3. **Validation Check:**
   - It checks if the entered `username` is `"admin"` and the `password` is `"password"`.
   - If either the `username` or `password` is incorrect:
     - It prints `"wrong user data"`.
     - Decreases the `counter` by `1`.
     - Displays the remaining attempts with the message: `"you still have {counter} tries left"`.

4. **Recursive Call:**
   - If the `counter` reaches `0`, it prints a message indicating all attempts have been exhausted: `"you have attempted all your tries, are you trying to hack this account ?"`.
   - If the `counter` is greater than `0`, it recursively calls the `login()` function with the updated `counter`, allowing the user another attempt to login.

5. **Successful Login:**
   - If the correct `username` and `password` are entered, it prints `"welcome admin"` and stops further execution.

### **Key Points:**
- **Recursion:**
  - The function calls itself recursively with the updated `counter` value each time the user fails to provide the correct credentials, thus creating a loop-like behavior without using explicit loops.
  
- **Termination:**
  - The recursion stops either when the user successfully logs in or when the `counter` reaches `0` (i.e., all attempts have been used up).

### **Example Output:**
Hereâ€™s how it would work with different scenarios:

1. **Successful Login on First Attempt:**
   ```
   username : admin
   password : password
   welcome admin
   ```

2. **Failed Attempts Followed by Success:**
   ```
   username : user
   password : 1234
   wrong user data
   you still have 2 tries left 
   
   username : admin
   password : password
   welcome admin
   ```

3. **All Attempts Exhausted:**
   ```
   username : user
   password : 1234
   wrong user data
   you still have 2 tries left 

   username : user
   password : 1234
   wrong user data
   you still have 1 tries left 

   username : user
   password : 1234
   wrong user data
   you still have 0 tries left 
   you have attempted all your tries, are you trying to hack this account ?
   ```

### **Improvements and Considerations:**
- **Security Note:** 
  - For a real application, avoid using hardcoded passwords and use hashing algorithms for storing passwords.
- **User Experience:**
  - Adding a slight delay before retries (e.g., using `time.sleep()`) could prevent rapid, automated attempts.
- **Recursion Limit:** 
  - Although this recursive approach works fine for a small number of attempts, Python's default recursion limit (usually 1000) could become an issue if you extend the logic further.
