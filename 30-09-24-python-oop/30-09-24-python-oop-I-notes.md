### Class Definition

```python
class Animal:
```
- This line defines a new class called `Animal`. A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances) that share common attributes and methods.

### Constructor Method

```python
def __init__(self, name, num_of_legs, sound):
```
- The `__init__` method is a special method in Python called a constructor. It initializes the attributes of an object when it is created.
- `self` refers to the instance of the class being created. `name`, `num_of_legs`, and `sound` are parameters that will be passed when an instance is created.

```python
self.name = name
self.num_of_legs = num_of_legs
self.sound = sound
```
- These lines assign the values of the parameters to instance variables:
  - `self.name` stores the name of the animal.
  - `self.num_of_legs` stores the number of legs the animal has.
  - `self.sound` stores the sound the animal makes.

### Instance Methods

```python
def walk(self):
```
- This line defines a method called `walk`, which describes an action that the animal can perform.

```python
return f"{self.name} is walking on {self.num_of_legs} legs"
```
- This line returns a string indicating that the animal is walking, including its name and the number of legs it has.

```python
def make_sound(self):
```
- This line defines another method called `make_sound`.

```python
return f"{self.name} said {self.sound}"
```
- This line returns a string that describes the sound the animal makes, using its name and the sound attribute.

### Creating an Instance

```python
cat = Animal('Cat', 4, 'Meow')
```
- Here, an instance of the `Animal` class is created and assigned to the variable `cat`.
- The `Animal` constructor is called with the arguments `'Cat'`, `4`, and `'Meow'`, initializing the instance with these values.

### Inspecting the Instance

```python
print(type(cat))
```
- This prints the type of the `cat` object, which will show `<class '__main__.Animal'>`, indicating that `cat` is an instance of the `Animal` class.

```python
print(dir(cat))
```
- This prints a list of all attributes and methods of the `cat` object. It includes built-in methods as well as the ones defined in the class.

```python
print(cat.name)
print(cat.num_of_legs)
print(cat.sound)
```
- These lines print the values of the `name`, `num_of_legs`, and `sound` attributes of the `cat` object, which will output:
  ```
  Cat
  4
  Meow
  ```

### Accessing Methods

```python
print(cat.walk())
```
- This calls the `walk` method of the `cat` object, which will output:
  ```
  Cat is walking on 4 legs
  ```

```python
print(cat.make_sound())
```
- This calls the `make_sound` method of the `cat` object, which will output:
  ```
  Cat said Meow
  ```

### Modifying an Attribute

```python
cat.name = 'dog'  # setting
```
- This line changes the `name` attribute of the `cat` object from `'Cat'` to `'dog'`.

```python
print(cat.make_sound())
```
- After changing the name, calling the `make_sound` method again will now output:
  ```
  dog said Meow
  ```

### Summary

- The `Animal` class defines a structure for creating animal objects with specific attributes (name, number of legs, sound) and behaviors (walking and making sound).
- An instance of `Animal` is created (a cat), its properties are accessed, and methods are called to demonstrate its behavior. The name of the instance is modified, showcasing the dynamic nature of object attributes.
